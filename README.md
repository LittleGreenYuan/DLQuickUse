# DLQuickUse
The core section of DL is implemented through a relatively simple example

## Existing network models

1. BP neural network (BP)
2. One-dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN)
3. A minimum unit script file that includes dataset creation, model construction, configuration parameters, training functions, evaluation functions, save functions, gradient accumulation and reloading parameter weights
